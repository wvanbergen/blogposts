# Blogpost staging area

This repository is the staging area for my blogposts. I am using this because I prefer to use a "real" text editor over a textarea element in a web browser, and I prefer markdown over a WYSIWYG editor.

Because I blog very little, I don't want to start my own blog. The result is that my posts end up on blogs that are willing to have them, usually my employer's. I am currently employed by [Shopify](http://www.shopify.com) so my blog posts most likely end up on the [Shopify technology blog](http://www.shopify.com/technology). Previously, I was employed by [Floorplanner](http://www.floorplanner.com); during those days my post ended up on the [Floorplanner techblog](http://techblog.floorplanner.com/).
